IBM has taken over [Cloudant] which I had been using as
a live site for [pry].
I signed up for a `Lite` free site on their new platform
to move `pry` before the March 31, 2018 deadline.

Once I figured out how to launch the service,
I copied and pasted the `pry.json` document from
the old service into the new service.
There were many confusing options for creating
user and API key, password pairs.
In the end, I used the account credentials
and tried to remove all other keys and passwords.
I updated the `pry` link using the new url,
which includes a key and encoded password.
So I think it is OK to leave the encoded password in the link.
