Using a penalty function technique, I used TensorFlow to solve
quadratic programming problems.

The penalty term used is proportional to 1/2 of the sum of the constraint errors squared
on the Lagranian function.
Initially the penalty is relaxed; as the solution is approached
the penalty term is tighted.
The key elements of the solution is a technique for estimating Lagranian
\\(\lambda\\) values.

I created a Jupyter notebook for
a sample problem with one equality constraint,
available [here](/notebooks/TF Single Equality Constrained Quadratic Optimizing.ipynb)
or viewed [online](https://github.com/cygnyx/cygnyx.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/TF Single Equality Constrained Quadratic Optimizing.ipynb) at GitHub.

For an inequality constraint, I used a similar technique but the Lagrangian \\(\lambda\\) values are non-negative.
The inequalities are represented as equalities along with an associated slack value.
An additional optimization technique is used to determine the slack values.
