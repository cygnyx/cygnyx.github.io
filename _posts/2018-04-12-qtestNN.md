title:  "Emulating qtest with an ANN"
tags: pointset Delaunay tensorflow ANN

I found that the `qtest` used in a Delaunay triangulation algorithm
was difficult to emulate with an ANN.


`qtest` determines if a point is in- or out-side the circumcircle
of a triangle specificied by 3 other points.
It seems that the critical missing feature for the ANN is the
center of the circumcircle.
This suggests that the ANN is no able to model this type of calculation.
However, all of features in the calculation where readily modeled.

I created a Jupyter notebook for
these tests,
available [here](/notebooks/qtestNN.ipynb)
or viewed [online](https://github.com/cygnyx/cygnyx.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/qtestNN.ipynb) at GitHub.
