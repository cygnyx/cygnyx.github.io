I read that GitHub has some support for Jekyll plugins.
With some difficulty I added the sitemap plugin that is supported.

First, I added `- jekyll-sitemap` under `gems:` in `_config.yml`
and ran:
```
gem jekyll-sitemap
```
but this generated a number of error messages and no sitemap.

Next, I added `gem "jekyll-sitemap", "~> 1.1.1"`
under `group :jekyll_plugins do`
and after `gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"` and ran
```
gem install jekyll-sitemap
```
which didn't work right. Then ran:
```
bundle install
```

After running:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
I had a robots.txt file on my localhost _site that
refered to `sitemap.xml` which contained references
to localhost URLs.
After deploying to GitHub the [robots.txt](/robots.txt)
links to [sitemap.xml](/sitemap.xml) which use
`cygnyx.com` in the URLs.

For SEO, I followed the instructions on [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag).
I added `gem "jekyll-seo-tag", "~> 2.2.3"` to `Gemfile`,
`- jekyll-seo-tag` to `_config.yml`,
and `seo` processing command in `_includes/head.html` before `</head>`.
There are many parameters that control the META data in `index.html`,
currently `title` and `description` are used.
