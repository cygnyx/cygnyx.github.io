Turns out that `select` is much faster than `sort` algorithms for calculating the median of a
data set.

I created a Jupyter notebook for
comparing the performance
available [here](/notebooks/Quickselect.ipynb)
or viewed [online](https://github.com/cygnyx/cygnyx.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Quickselect.ipynb) at GitHub.
The notebook includes code for 2 versions of quick select
and compares the runtime performance to the built-in sort.
