[Bookmarklets][BM] have been around for a long time.
The concept is to attached some Javascript code in a bookmark.
Over the years this process has changed.
The tricky bit is to copy the link into an existing bookmark.
So, for example, you can make a bookmark for this page,
then in your browser edit the bookmark with a name like
`Convert a Webpage to JSON`.

Here is a list of use features for this utility:
- The resulting JSON string is put in the cut buffer.
- It should handle " and ' properly.
- It would be nice if sections that are not visible on the page, are not included in the JSON.

<p style="display:none">This is a non-displayed paragraph</p>

<table id="2x2">
<caption>This is an example of table.</caption>
<thead><tr><th>Col 1</th><th>Col 2</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Row 1, Col 1</td><td>Row 1, Col 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Row 2, Col 1</td><td>Row 2, Col 2</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
