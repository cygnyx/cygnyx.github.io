[AWS][AWS] - Amazon Web Services 

Using the web interface built an EC2 t2.micro instance in US-West following [steps by Alex][alex].
After starting the instance:
```bash
ssh ec2-XXXXXXXXX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```
To confirm ssh CLI access.
In ~/.ssh, I saved the rsa key in from_amazon_authorized_keys.
In config, I added Host *.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com entry
with this as the IdentityFile and setting User.
In Emacs, using tramp I can access the filesystem with /XXXXXXXXX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/
and use Esc-! to run commands there.

Created an IAM cli user and Administrator group [following AWS steps][IAM].
This process creates an ID and Key.

[Created aws conda environment with:][env]
```bash
conda create --name aws
conda install python=3.7
pip install --upgrade awscli
aws --version
aws configure
```
and added ID, key, region and format [following AWS steps][conf].
This operates on ~/.aws directory.
Credentials are stored in plain text and the configuration information.

To get a list of running instances and public address:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --output text | egrep ^INSTANCES | cut -f9,15
```

To stop an instance:
```bash
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids XXXXXXXXXXXXXX --output text
```
