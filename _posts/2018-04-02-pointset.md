The pointset class provides a framework for studying Delaunay triangulations.

In addition to the Delaunay triangulation a number of additional operations are implemented on triangulation,
including minimum spanning tree, Gabriel graphs, and point location. The point location is a surprisingly
difficult algorithm.
I created a Jupyter notebook for
the implementation
available [here](/notebooks/Quickselect.ipynb)
or viewed [online](https://github.com/cygnyx/cygnyx.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Quickselect.ipynb) at GitHub.
When the notebook completes successfully, the final cell converts the notebook into a Python module.
