title:  "Noise and Batch Size in Linear Regression"
tags: tensorflow

Using a linear regression, I find that a batch size of 32 or larger
works best in tensorflow.

I created a Jupyter notebook for
linear regression using various data sizes, noise levels and batch sizes.
Using a larger batch size decreases processing time and
seems to improve the parameter search process.
It is
available [here](/notebooks/Noise and Batch Size in Linear Regression.ipynb)
or viewed [online](https://github.com/cygnyx/cygnyx.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Noise and Batch Size in Linear Regression.ipynb) at GitHub.
