I created a Jupyter notebook for modeling unary functions
available [here](/notebooks/UnaryOperatorsNN.ipynb)
or viewed [online](https://github.com/cygnyx/cygnyx.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/UnaryOperatorsNN.ipynb) at GitHub.
And [here](/notebooks/BinaryOperatorsNN.ipynb)
is a notebook for binary functions
or [online](https://github.com/cygnyx/cygnyx.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/BinaryOperatorsNN.ipynb).

This provides some insight to how ANN work on simple problems.
Note that these notebooks use `tf.contrib.learn.DNNRegressor` to do a regression, not a classification.
